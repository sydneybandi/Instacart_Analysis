 # Instacart Analysis
 
 The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data) is a relational set of files describing customers' orders over time.
 The goal is to predict which products will be in a user's next order. The dataset is anonymized and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. For each user, Instacart provides between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. Instacart also provides the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders.

Here are the different notebooks:
